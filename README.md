# Data and Code Accompanying the Study "Developing an annotation framework for word formation processes in comparative linguistics"

This repository provides the data and code accompanying the study by Schweikhard and List, presenting an annotation framework for word formation processes in comparative linguistics. Please cite the data by citing the original publication:

> Schweikhard, N. E. and List, J.-M. (2020): Developing an annotation framework for word formation processes in comparative linguistics. SKASE Journal of Theoretical Linguistics. 17.1: 2-26.

To get started, see in the folder `examples`, where you find example data for testing the code and detailed instructions. These instructions are also given in the PDF file `appendix.pdf`, which helps you to run all experiments we did in the study, but also to learn more about the annotation practice and the data we used.
